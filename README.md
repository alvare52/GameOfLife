### Basic Rules
  1. Any living cell that has 2 or 3 neighboring live cells stays alive for the next generation
  2. Any dead cell that has exactly 3 living neighbors will come back to life in the next generation
  3. If a living or dead cell doesn't meet one of these conditions, it will die in the next generation
